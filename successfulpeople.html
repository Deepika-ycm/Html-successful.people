  Successful people will always work hard.The best way I have found is a little pad of paper we issue called ‘The Six Most Important Things.’ I teach consultants to write down the six most important things they have to do the next day, every night before they go to bed.” Mary Kay Ash

  A study by psychology professor Dr. Gail Matthews found that people who write down their goals are 42% more likely to achieve them than those who don’t.
  
  Successful people understand that winging it rarely leads to success. They don’t leave their day to chance. They intentionally set clear goals and plan their day to achieve them.
